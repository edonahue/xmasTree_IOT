# xmasTree_IOT
Raspberry Pi project using python flask webserver to allow web-based control of christmas lights


I built this project to lazily control our christmas tree lights using a PowerSwitch Tail II and a Raspberry Pi.  A simple python script and flask based webserver are used to build a webpage which includes a switch for the lights.  I've also added a feature to log our toggling of the lights.


This was based around the "Weblamp" tutorial from Getting Started with Raspberry Pi by Matt Richardson and Shaun Wallace.  Matt Richardson's write-up can be found here:

I've written about this project on the following two blog posts:
